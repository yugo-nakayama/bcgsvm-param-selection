## Abstract
This paper proposes a new loss for selecting kernel parameters in HDLSS settings.

## Method
### Background
- BC-SVM / RSVM framework (brief).

### Proposed loss
Define an SNR-type loss based on kernel block-constants and estimate it from data.

## Experiments
### Simulation
### Real data

## Reproducibility
All results can be reproduced via `targets::tar_make()` and `quarto render`.
